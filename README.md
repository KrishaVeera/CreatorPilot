# CreatorPilot
CreatorPilot helps creators and small businesses predict content performance before they post.

Conducted exploratory analysis on 50k+ TikTok videos, revealing that claims drive higher engagement and banned accounts correlate with virality.

Built ML predictors for TikTok content, including a topic-based virality model, full-transcript virality model, and ban-risk classifier using Ridge, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Engineered features (readability, sentiment, keywords, stylistic cues) and delivered inference-ready pipelines producing probabilities of video virality and ban risk.
